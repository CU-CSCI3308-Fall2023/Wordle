## Thursday 11/9 after lab (2:35 pm) CSEL

1. Discussed what is needed for the UI in each page of application. Additionally brainstormed design of backend for game and scoreboard page.
2. Decided to include the following columns in the scoreboard: Ranking, Username, Total Points, Average Score, and Games Played. Determined that points would start at 6 in the beginning of a game and decrease by 1 for each failed row.
3. Discussed options for styles, going to use Bootstrap.
4. Discussed next steps. Assigned roles for writing test case descriptions as well as /login endpoint.
