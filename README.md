# Wordle

## Description
Our application is a guessing game where the user has six chances to guess a five letter word. The user will type on a word, and the application will respond by telling the user which letters they guessed correctly, and if they are in the correct location. The userâ€™s goal is to guess the word in the fewest possible number of guesses. 
The five letter word is selected randomly from a database with thousands of possible choices. After a word is selected from the database, it will be removed so that a player cannot guess the same word twice. The player will be able to register their account, log in and out of their account, view their statistics, view the instructions for the game, and see a scoreboard.
